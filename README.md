##Description

aGROW is an online app dedicated to benefiting farmers by providing a platform for lending 
and renting farming equipment, including tractors, threshers, ploughs, etc.


##Problem it solves

In rural areas, there is often a shortage of agricultural equipment due to the high cost of 
purchase for individual farmers. Consequently, during the harvest season, there is a high demand 
for these tools, leading to issues such as farmers acquiring tools on a first-come-first-serve 
basis or facing crop deterioration due to delayed access.

**aGROW** solves this problem by allowing farmers to rent tools from other farmers, reducing 
dependency on neighbors and connections.
